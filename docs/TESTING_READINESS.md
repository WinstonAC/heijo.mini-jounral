## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Heij≈ç ‚Äî Testing Readiness & Feature Validation Report

**Scope:** This report reflects the current Heij≈ç Mini‚ÄëJournal web app codebase at `Journal.heijo`. It evaluates readiness for structured QA and documents how implemented features work in practice.

---

### ‚úÖ 1) Feature Completeness & Behavior

For each feature: how it works (flow, logic, data path) + readiness.

#### Authentication (OAuth)
- How it works: Supabase Auth using magic link and email/password as fallback (`lib/auth.tsx`, `lib/supabaseClient.ts`, `app/login/page.tsx`). The app listens to `onAuthStateChange` and persists session JSON to `localStorage` under `heijo_session` to survive refresh/restart.
- Tokens & scopes: Managed by Supabase client SDK; no Google/Microsoft OAuth flows present. Scopes limited to Supabase Auth; no external calendar scopes.
- Re-auth after restart: Yes, via Supabase session + `localStorage` backup.
- Readiness: ‚ùå Missing (Google/Microsoft OAuth). Core auth for journal is ‚úÖ Works.

#### Calendar Lookup + Slot Finder
- How it works: Not implemented. No Google Calendar or Microsoft Graph free/busy calls or timezone handling in code.
- Readiness: ‚ùå Missing.

#### Scheduling & Reminders
- How it works: Not implemented. No event creation, overlap logic, or reminder triggers. PWA mentions optional reminders in docs, but no code path.
- Readiness: ‚ùå Missing.

#### Meditation Modalities
- How it works: Not implemented. No audio modality loader or duration-based playback logic. Only voice transcription (Web Speech API) exists (`lib/voiceToText.ts`).
- Readiness: ‚ùå Missing.

#### Local Storage & State Persistence
- How it works:
  - Journal entries: Hybrid storage with local-first save and optional Supabase sync (`lib/store.ts`). Entries stored in `localStorage` key `heijo-journal-entries`; sync to Supabase when configured. Backfill `sync_status` on legacy items.
  - Secure/encrypted storage: `lib/secureStorage.ts` and `lib/encryption.ts` provide AES‚ÄëGCM with device keys and IndexedDB object store for encrypted blobs (used by GDPR manager for export/delete).
  - Consent/settings: `lib/gdpr.ts` uses `localStorage` key `heijo-consent-settings` for microphone, data storage, and analytics consent.
  - Session: Supabase session also persisted in `localStorage` as `heijo_session` in `lib/auth.tsx`.
  - Persistence across sessions: Yes, via `localStorage` and IndexedDB; cloud sync optional via Supabase.
  - Privacy/deletion: `gdprManager.deleteAllData()` clears secure data and consent keys; export JSON/CSV supported. Import/restore from JSON backup now available via Privacy Settings.
- Readiness: ‚úÖ Works.

#### Analytics / Usage Tracking
- How it works: Local‚Äëonly analytics collected with consent (`lib/analytics.ts`). Events tracked to `localStorage` under `heijo-analytics-data` and `heijo-analytics-events`. Dashboard UI reads data in `components/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`.
- Sync to backend: No; local only.
- View/reset: Users can view metrics in `AnalyticsDashboard` (when rendered) and `gdprManager` can clear data.
- Readiness: ‚úÖ Works (local‚Äëonly).

#### Premium Tier Logic
- How it works: Not present. No gating flags, upgrade flow, or entitlement checks.
- Readiness: ‚ùå Missing.

#### Enterprise Dashboard
- How it works: Not present. No admin/SSO/roles. The included `components/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` is per‚Äëuser local data, not enterprise aggregation.
- Readiness: ‚ùå Missing.

### üìÑ 2) Documentation & Technical Specs
- Architecture/tech docs: Present under `docs/technical` and `docs/product`. No Google/Microsoft integration docs (not implemented).
- `.env.example`: Present for Supabase keys only; no calendar credentials (not applicable).
- Extension build/packaging (Chrome + O365): Present (`docs/technical/EXTENSION_PACKAGING.md`).
- Database schema/auth rules: Included in README and `docs/technical/DATABASE.md`; RLS policies documented.
- QA matrices: Not found.

Gaps: OAuth provider docs, QA matrix.

---

### üìò 3) README Verification
- Overview, stack, install, dev: Present.
- Extension build/load: Present (linked to `docs/technical/EXTENSION_PACKAGING.md`).
- Local storage & privacy explanation: Present; backup/restore described in Privacy Settings and `gdpr.ts`.
- Testing commands/troubleshooting: Present (expanded troubleshooting section).

Additional beta docs for testers:
- Tester Onboarding: `docs/TESTER_ONBOARDING.md`
- What To Test: `docs/WHAT_TO_TEST.md`

Gaps: None critical for current scope.

---

### üß™ 4) Code & Environment Health
- Linting/formatting: ESLint config present; Tailwind configured.
- Build: Next.js 14 project; standard `build`/`start` scripts.
- Env validation: Supabase URL/key required when sync is enabled; offline mode works without.
- CI/CD: Vercel config present; CI guidance added (`docs/technical/DEPLOYMENT.md`).
- Versions/changelog: Versions in `package.json`; release notes in README; CHANGELOG present (`CHANGELOG.md`).

---

### üéØ 5) QA Scenario Checklist (What happens + data path)
1) Google login success/failure: Not implemented. N/A.
2) Microsoft login success/failure: Not implemented. N/A.
3) Calendar parsing & time‚Äëzone accuracy: Not implemented. N/A.
4) Event creation + pre‚Äëreminder firing: Not implemented. N/A.
5) Meditation playback & timer logic: Not implemented. N/A.
6) Local‚Äëstorage persistence after refresh: On entry save, data is written to `localStorage` (`heijo-journal-entries`). On reload, entries hydrate from `localStorage`; if Supabase configured, background sync attempts to persist to `journal_entries` with `user_id`.
7) Premium‚Äëtier unlock flow: Not implemented.
8) Error states (offline, invalid token, no calendar access):
   - Offline: Core journaling and voice transcription function offline; sync deferred.
   - Invalid token: Supabase handles session invalidation; session cleared and user redirected to login.
   - No calendar access: N/A.
9) Enterprise admin actions: Not implemented.

### üì¶ Keys and Local Storage Checklist
- `heijo_session` (localStorage): Supabase session JSON for resilience.
- `heijo-journal-entries` (localStorage): Array of entries with `sync_status` and optional `last_synced`.
- `HeijoSecureStorage` (IndexedDB): Encrypted entries/metadata via `secureStorage`.
- `heijo-consent-settings` (localStorage): Consent flags for microphone, storage, analytics.
- `heijo-analytics-data` / `heijo-analytics-events` (localStorage): Usage metrics and events.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Incomplete / Partial Areas
- Google/Microsoft OAuth, calendar free/busy, scheduling/reminders, meditation modalities, premium gating, enterprise dashboard: ‚ùå Missing.
- QA matrix: ‚ùå Missing.

---

### üß© Technical Risks or Blockers
- Feature scope mismatch vs. docs (mentions of calendar/reminders are roadmap, not implemented).
- Security headers allow `'unsafe-inline'`/`'unsafe-eval'` for Next.js; acceptable but should be revisited if extension CSPs are stricter.
- Duplicate content folders (see note below) can confuse reviewers if committed.

---

### üöÄ Next Steps Before QA Launch
- Environment & RLS: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set; verify RLS policies per `docs/technical/DATABASE.md`.
- Capacity: Confirm Supabase project and hosting plan can handle ~100 light users (auth requests, bandwidth, storage).
- Documentation: Share `docs/TESTER_ONBOARDING.md` and `docs/WHAT_TO_TEST.md` with testers.
- Feedback: Direct testers to GitHub Issues for bug reports.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note on Duplicate Files/Paths
The repository contains a nested iCloud Drive mirror under `Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/Journal.heijo/‚Ä¶` that duplicates files like `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`. These are not separate features‚Äîjust synced copies. Recommended: treat the project root as authoritative and exclude `Library/` from version control to avoid confusion.
