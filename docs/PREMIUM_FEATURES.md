### Storage Location
- **Primary**: Browser `localStorage` (local-first)

- **Strategy**: Hybrid storage - local-first, cloud backup

### Activation
1. Go to **Settings** → **Consent Settings**
2. Toggle **"Premium Cloud Sync"** ON
3. If not premium: Click "Activate Premium" (free for testing)
4. Choose to sync existing entries or skip
5. New entries automatically sync to cloud

### Technical Details

#### Premium Status Storage
- **Location**: Supabase `user_metadata.premium` (boolean)
- **Testing**: Manual toggle updates `user_metadata.premium = true`
- **Future**: Platform receipt verification (Chrome/App Store)

#### Sync Behavior
- **Local-first**: Entries always save to `localStorage` first
- **Cloud sync**: Only if premium is active
- **Merge strategy**: Local entries prioritized, cloud merged
- **Conflict resolution**: Local version takes precedence

#### Data Migration
When upgrading to premium:
- User is prompted: "Sync your existing X entries to the cloud?"
- Options:
  - **Sync Now**: All localStorage entries uploaded to Supabase
  - **Skip**: Only new entries will sync
  - **Cancel**: Premium activation cancelled

#### Deactivation
When disabling premium:
- **Warning**: "You have 24 hours to export your data. Access will be revoked after that."
- **Data**: Cloud data remains for 24 hours, then deleted
- **Local**: localStorage entries remain (no deletion)
- **Fallback**: Automatically switches back to local-only mode

  // Merge cloud and local entries
  // Sync local-only entries to cloud
}
```

### Future Payment Integration

**TODO: When ready for production:**

1. **Chrome Web Store**
   - Use Chrome Payment API
   - Verify purchase receipt
   - Update `user_metadata.premium` based on receipt

2. **App Store**
   - Use App Store in-app purchase API
   - Verify receipt server-side
   - Update `user_metadata.premium` based on receipt
